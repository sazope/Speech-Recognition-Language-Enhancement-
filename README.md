# Flip-AAC

Flip AAC is a design research project exploring the implementation of emerging technologies into Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) tools. Our research aims to create generalized translation tools for people who rely on non-verbal speech methods to allow for seamless adaptation to verbal conversation.

Flip AAC is a research project out of Syracuse University, funded by the SOURCE undergraduate research fellowship program. This work was completed in association with the Intelligence++ initiative, as well as the InclusiveU program. The research was conducted by design undergraduates Domenic Gallo and Bella Young, with software development work from Shreya Zope and Janhavi Ghuge.
